# First things first

First is a journal of near-future technology and society.
We predict where current conditions will lead us.
Doing so requires an understanding of those conditions.
With this understanding, we can also confront, support, and suggest more promising alternatives.
By providing these alternatives, we empower ourselves to start asking "Where would we like to go?" instead of "Where are we being led?"
Wherever that may be, we want to get there first.

First is also a living experiment in digital publishing by [Worb Co.](worb.co)
While it will express our founding ideals, it will also be powered by our own technology.
Writing will be the first phase of Worb Co., by which we will imagine the future we will set out to create.
First will also be the first true implementation of Worb Core, a website engine that will power our future projects, and maybe yours.
Finally, publishing has always been our first dream and passion.

First is also deeply concerned with the state of the World Wide Web.
As a technological platform for democratic discourse, the WWW is unsurpassed.
The web was originally built for static pages and documents, but has lept far beyond that initial purpose, leaving publishers of documents behind.
Technologists have flourished, but purveyors of discourse have suffered as a result of the movement beyond the document.

First is foremost a publication, but will ultimately help publishers transcend the narrow bounds of document collections.
The ease with which we can publish First from anywhere, at anytime, for minimal cost, is magnificent.
There is no pulp version, there is nothing to buy.
We can publish work that is unpublishable in other formats.
In that spirit, First is web first.
