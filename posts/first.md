# First things first

_First_ is a journal of near-future technology and society.
We predict where current conditions will lead us.
Doing so requires an understanding of those conditions.
With this understanding, we can also confront, support, and suggest more promising alternatives.
This empowers us to ask "Where would we like to go?" instead of "Where are we being led?"
Wherever that may be, we want to get there first.

_First_ is foremost a publication, but it is wholly digital.
It will move and grow in ways that would be constricted by other formats.
There is no pulp version, there is nothing to buy.
The ease with which we can publish _First_ from anywhere, at anytime, for minimal cost, is magnificent.
We can experiment in ways that would be impossible in other formats.

Behind this effort is Worb Core.
_First_ is published by [Worb Co.][worbco] and it is a testing ground for both our ideas and our own technologies.
Writing is the mission of the first phase of Worb Co., by which we will imagine the future we will set out to create.
This will be the first true implementation, built from the ground up, of Worb Core.
Worb Core will provide the technological foundation for future projects, but not just ours.

With luck and skill, we will provide anyone the foundation they need to communicate effectively on the modern Web.
That means going beyond documents, the most straightforward and simplistic Web application, and towards a richer and more expressive range of applications.
This kind of expression is still, unfortunately, out of reach of so many.
This limits us to thinking, questioning, and examining in terms that already exist and not in terms that could exist.
Of course, we will not completely solve these problems.
But we hope to provide a sturdy foundation for others to build upon.

Last, we assume that while the Internet is good, people are better.
We put people ahead of techniques and technology.
This is the critical quality of ourselves, our strategies, and our goals.
Relying on nerds to understand the breadth or depth of most problems is foolish.
Without a firm understanding of who we are helping, and why, our solutions will be woefully inadequate.
Let us amplify many different voices and reflect many different experiences.
We will absolutely put people first.

This is _First_.
It will be fruitful, challenging, exploratory, and ambitious.
This marks our first steps towards a better future.
