# The Attention Wars

My job is to figure out how to make people click on things, and then once they do, how to make them keep clicking. 
Before they stop clicking, my job is to figure out how to make them sign up for a subscription to us on some network so that we can catch them again.
And again.
And again.
Until we've wormed our way so deeply into their heads that we don't even have to catch them again.
In an ideal scenario, they just wake up and come find us.
Maybe without even thinking about it.

Product Managers like me are taught to quickly and efficiently figure out what consumers want.
By what consumers want, we mean: what consumers will spend time on.
We judge whether consumers want something by seeing how many times they visit and click our pages.
By how often they come back and how long they stay when they do.
By how often they tell their friends about our products.

The truth is, these metrics are, at best, an indirect measure of what consumers want. 
It's much more efficient to look at how people behave than it is to ask them what makes them happy.

By most measures, Facebook is the most successfully optimized product ever made.
The average American spends over [40 minutes per day](https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/) on Facebook.
I spend way more time with it, both for work and pleasure.
But I don't wake up excited to spend hours there.
I don't feel fulfilled when I check my phone for the final time before going to bed.
It just happens.

I suspect that using Facebook makes very few people feel happy.
Or at least happy in a healthy way. 
[Numerous studies](http://www.medicaldaily.com/facebook-addiction-activates-same-brain-areas-drugs-how-social-media-sites-hook-you-320252) have found that Facebook (and most social media) affects our brains like a drug.
Its finely tuned stream of customized updates gives us a quick hit of cheap pleasure the first few times we use it, and its fantastically optimized alert system keeps us coming back.
Eventually, we don't need the alerts.
We can't go a day without visiting. 
We become dependent.
Instead of being a leisure activity we use to fill time, it becomes something we must use to feel good about ourselves.

Of course, that cycle is entirely by design. 
People like me have access to a cottage industry of articles, tutorials, books, services and products that promise to teach us how to build products just like Facebook.
We use a lot of names to describe this approach, but it all boils down to one thing: using modern psychology and modern technology to build addicting products and services.

## The Inversion of Leisure

Once upon a time, the word competition meant something.
Newspapers competed with other newspapers.
Books competed with other books.
Radio shows competed with other radio shows (and then, only ones on at the same time).

Wide adoption of the Internet changed all that. 
Before it, consumers had limited options for how to spend their time. 
Now that everyone has nearly instant access to almost anything, only one thing remains scarce: time. 
As a result, in the last ten years, technology companies have shifted from competing with other similar companies to competing with _everything else_ that occupies a consumer's time, online and off. 
We call it competing for attention.

The trend has become especially pernicious due to the widespread adoption of the smartphone. 
Now that the Internet is just about everywhere, competition is everywhere, and everywhen.
Technology companies are constantly engaging in fierce battles to capture smaller and smaller moments of everyone's attention.
The 5 minutes in between your door and the subway.
Your idle time at work.
Every awkward moment at a party.
In an ideal technoutopia, there won't be a second of anyone's life that isn't filled with consuming something on a screen.

And herein lies the problem. 
Technology is supposed to make life easier by making production more efficient and giving us more leisure time to spend as we will.
Instead, by making products so addicting that they become dependencies and racing to consume every second of our attention, technology companies are deciding how we use our leisure time for us.

## The Great Diversion

Fortunately, there are ways to use these very techniques to break out of the cycle.

Product designers can start asking their users what truly makes them happy, and optimizing for those outcomes instead of shallow engagement metrics.
Helping users achieve true happiness is much harder to measure, much less accomplish, but the gains are worth it: imagine how much more valuable a product that measurably helps people self-actualize will be than one that delivers superficial thrills.

Similarly, it should be possible to overcome the addictive properties of existing products by hooking into the very mechanisms that make them so powerfully habit-forming. 
Product designers and users should come together to find ways to direct attention from habit-forming products to more desirable experiences, thus developing new, more fulfilling habit loops.
For example, if you want to read a book instead of check Twitter, find a way to insert a reading trigger into your social feed, like I did with a team of like-minded technologists [a few weeks ago](https://hackdash.org/projects/5691bc9362b2cc5d050af6fc).

Once we develop technologies that help us fulfill real needs rather than addict us, we'll never go back to the attention wars.
