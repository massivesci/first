# The Attention Wars

My job is to figure out how to make people click on things, and then once they do, how to make them keep clicking.
Before they stop clicking, my job is to figure out how to make them sign up for a subscription to us on some network so that we can catch them again.
And again.
And again.
Until we've wormed our way so deeply into their heads that we don't even have to catch them again.
In an ideal scenario, they just wake up and come find us.
Maybe without even thinking about it.

Product Managers like me are taught to quickly and efficiently figure out what consumers want.
By what consumers want, we mean: what consumers will spend time on.
We judge whether consumers want something by seeing how many times they visit and click our pages.
By how often they come back and how long they stay when they do.
By how often they tell their friends about our products.

The truth is, these metrics are, at best, an indirect measure of what consumers want.
It's much more efficient to look at how people behave than it is to ask them what makes them happy.

I suspect that using Facebook makes very few people feel happy.
Or at least happy in a healthy way.
[Numerous studies](http://www.medicaldaily.com/facebook-addiction-activates-same-brain-areas-drugs-how-social-media-sites-hook-you-320252) have found that Facebook (and most social media) affects our brains like a drug.
Its finely tuned stream of customized updates gives us a quick hit of cheap pleasure the first few times we use it, and its fantastically optimized alert system keeps us coming back.
Eventually, we don't need the alerts.
We can't go a day without visiting.
We become dependent.
Instead of being a leisure activity we use to fill time, it becomes something we must use to feel good about ourselves.

By most measures, Facebook is the most successfully optimized product ever made.
The average American spends over [40 minutes per day](https://zephoria.com/top-15-valuable-facebook-statistics/) on Facebook.
I spend way more time with it, both for work and pleasure.
But I don't wake up excited to spend hours there.
I don't feel fulfilled when I check my phone for the final time before going to bed.
It just happens.

Of course, that cycle is entirely by design.
People like me have access to a cottage industry of articles, tutorials, books, services and products that promise to teach us how to build products just like Facebook.
We use a lot of names to describe this approach, but it all boils down to one thing: using modern psychology and modern technology to build addicting products and services.

## The Inversion of Leisure

The Internet has changed the meaning of competition.
Before it, consumers had limited options for how to spend their time.
Newspapers competed with other newspapers, books competed with other books, and
radio shows competed with other radio shows (and then, only ones on at the same time).
Now that we have immediate access to almost anything, only time is scarce.
As a result, technology companies have shifted from competing with other similar companies to competing with _everything else_ that occupies a consumer's time, online and off.
We call it competing for attention.

Smartphones have made this trend especially pernicious.
Now that the Internet is just about everywhere, competition is everywhere, and everywhen.
Technology companies are ferociously working to capture smaller and smaller moments of everyone's attention.
The 5 minutes in between your door and the subway.
Your idle time at work.
Every awkward moment at a party.
In an ideal technoutopia, there won't be a second of anyone's life that isn't filled with consuming something on a screen.

> I think this can be made more general: in a capitalist utopia, everyone is in a state of perpetual consumption.

And herein lies the problem.
Technology is supposed to make life easier by making production more efficient and giving us more leisure time to spend as we will.
Instead, by making products so addicting that they become dependencies and racing to consume every second of our attention, technology companies are deciding how we use our leisure time for us.

> [Jevons Paradox!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)

> I think there's lots of issues that you could pick up on here, so I think you need to spend more time explaining why _this one_ is worth focusing on, as well as acknowledging other adjacent issues. What i'm saying is, "technology companies are deciding how we use our leisure time for us" is not self-evident. Mostly because your premise, "technology is supposed to make life easier by making production more efficient and giving us more leisure time to spend as we will" could lead in many directions. So maybe flesh that claim out more.

> Like, you could take this essay in a totally different direction by saying "well, technology is supposed to create leisure time by increasing efficiency, but what ends up happening is that we just do more in that same amount time instead of less (Jevons), which we are incentivized to do because the only way you increase GDP is by increasing efficiency. So maybe the actual problem is that we've been culturally corralled into working more, whereby consuming advertising-driven media we're actually increasing the overall productivity of society and leisure itself doesn't really exist at all. So that makes social media a kind of unpaid labor that we all freely engage in, or is it so free? Because as you say it operates in manipulative ways to make us dependent on it. So maybe actually technology has just manipulated us into working more for less and, Welp, that's just bascially Late Capitalism.

> So that's just an example, but I was able to draw a pretty different conclusion based on the premise you stated above. So! I was able to save you 2 Â¶s in this section with some easy editing, so blow up the "And herein lies the problem" paragraph, and if it gets too heavy you can definitely afford to break it into 2.

## The Great Diversion

Fortunately, we can apply these same techniques to breaking out of the cycle.

Product designers can start asking their users what truly makes them happy, and optimizing for those outcomes instead of shallow engagement metrics.
Helping users achieve true happiness is much harder to measure, much less accomplish, but the gains are worth it: imagine how much more valuable a product that measurably helps people self-actualize will be than one that delivers superficial thrills.

Similarly, it should be possible to overcome the addictive properties of existing products by hooking into the very mechanisms that make them so powerfully habit-forming.
Product designers and users should come together to find ways to direct attention from habit-forming products to more desirable experiences, thus developing new, more fulfilling habit loops.
For example, if you want to read a book instead of check Twitter, find a way to insert a reading trigger into your social feed, like I did with a like-minded team [a few weeks ago](https://hackdash.org/projects/5691bc9362b2cc5d050af6fc).

Once we develop technologies that help us fulfill real needs rather than addict us, we'll never go back to the attention wars.

> Definitely dig into this more, after all it's the most interesting part of your piece! What obstacles are there to these solutions? Who is capable of implementing these solutions, i.e. what specific techniques can Product Managers develop to fix this problem? How can we measure success, or is happiness the only desirable outcome (and if it is, omg plz explain why). Where can these approaches be implemented (you mention twitter, is coopting feeds the right way to go, or are the feeds themselves the problem in the first place)? How do you incentivize personal fulfillment and satisfaction ("this moment of personal growth brought to you by Khan Academy")?

> A few general notes:

> I'm worried about the conflation of the Web with the Internet here.

> I would really like to see you use "we" instead of "technology companies" since you insert yourself at the beginning and your knowledge of these issues is informed by your work.

> Actually, I think a "Me" and "You" pronoun situation would make this piece really pop. As in, "Here's what I, Gabe, am doing to YOU, reader." Own it!
